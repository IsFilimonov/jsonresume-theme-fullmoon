# Fullmoon theme for JSON Resume

A fullmoon template for [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) based on a [StackOverflow](https://github.com/phoinixi/jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow) theme.


## Get ready?
More [information](https://jsonresume.org/getting-started/) about JSON Resume start.

### Command Line Tool
Install JSON Resume Command Line Tool globally for **NPM**:
```bash
npm install -g resume-cli
```

Official [CLT repository](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) with all commands.


### Resume file
- Create `resume.json` file according a [schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).
- Hosting a file `https://registry.jsonresume.org/{your_github_username}` and choose a theme to set `{ "meta": { "theme": "elegant" } }`. 

*Note*: a theme must be official register (check [dependencies](https://github.com/jsonresume/registry-functions/blob/master/functions/package.json)).


## Usage

- Start local server from folder where the `resume.json` puts:
```bash
resume serve
```

- If a theme is officially register you can change a render:
```bash
resume serve --theme <theme name>
```

- If you have you own theme locally, just put a `resume.json` to the root folder:
```bash
resume serve --theme .
```
